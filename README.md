This assignment has two objectives:
1) To understand the process of using visualizations to perform exploratory data analysis. You willformulate and answer a series of specific questions about the data by visual exploration to confirm or disconfirm your hypotheses about the data.
2) To create an interactive dashboard. After answering the questions, you pose, you should create a final visualization (an interactive dashboard) designed to answer your most significant questions and allow the viewer to explore the dataset on their own.


Data Set: Movie & Netflix Data
The first dataset contains important statistics from a large sample of movies. The data includes the movie
budget and revenue from different sources as well as ratings from RottenTomatoes, The Numbers and
IMDB. The second data set includes titles from Netflix. You can select one of the datasets to create your
dashboard or decide to use both of them.
The second dataset contains important recession historical data, you will aggregate the data into the
current movie and Netflix data set and try to identify the correlation between the recession, movies US
Gross revenue, Worldwide Gross revenue and the production budget variance over the years by plotting
the data into the visualization using the type you see fit to complement the overall analysis. Using the
recession dataset, you need to answer all the following three questions using the same visualization:
1. Is the movie's US revenue affected by the recession? If yes, show the correlation using the
correct visualization.
2. Is the movie's worldwide revenue affected by the recession? If yes, show the correlation using the
correct visualization.
3. Is the movie budget affected by the recession? If yes, show the correlation using the correct
visualization.
